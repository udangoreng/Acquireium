Angelfish are in the cichlid family, which is why they are considered semi-aggressive. They can be territorial especially if they have decided to lay eggs. To reduce the chance of aggression, try adding the Angels to the aquarium last. They do prefer slightly more acidic water conditions. Adding driftwood can help naturally soften the water while also providing a place for the angels to hide. Be sure to feed them a variety of foods that include vegetables and meaty substances.",

Males typically display spots on their anal fins and are also usually more colorful than the females. However, the males are also usually more aggressive, so we suggest a ratio of 3 to 4 females to one male. They prefer an aquarium with a sandy substrate with lots of hiding spaces. In the wild, the Electric Yellow Cichlids are found in brackish waters, so they will do best in aquariums with a basic pH and low salinity. Use caution when choosing aquarium's size because they can grow to about 6'' long. Be sure to feed a varied diet of meaty foods and pellets that contain vegetable matter.",

They come in a variety of colors and patterns, which makes them all the more exciting. Koi can live 25-35 years or more in captivity when properly cared for, and get as large as 3 feet long, so they will need a large space made specifically for koi. They are considered diggers, so use caution when adding plants because they can get uprooted. Use large rocks to help keep the plants anchored down. Feeding many times a day is recommended since they are very active swimmers. Koi are very messy eaters, so be sure to monitor the water quality and perform water changes as needed. They will eat almost any pellet or flake that you offer, but be sure the food has vegetable foods in it. Freshwater food with vegetables will help prevent swim bladder problems.",
